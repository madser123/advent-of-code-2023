# üéÑ Advent Of Code 2023

My solutions to AOC2023.

## ü•Ö Goals
* Pure rust
* No external libraries
* Modular code
* Error handling
* Learn more efficient algorithms/optimizations
* All days combined running in under 1s

## ‚ò†Ô∏è Fails
* **Day 5** - Completed without any external help. I however had to resort to getting a hint on what algorithm to use in order to optimize, as my initial solution ran for +10 minutes. A small win on implementing an algorithm i didn't know before.

* **Day 8** - Completed but never finished *completely* on my own as my initial solution ran for hours without ever ending (Which i knew would happen). I had to get a hint on how to solve this, which lead to implementing LCM.
