# üéÑ Advent Of Code 2023

My solutions to AOC2023.

## ü•Ö Goals
* Pure rust
* No external libraries
* Modular code
* Error handling
* Learn more efficient algorithms/optimizations
* All days combined running in under 1s

## ‚ò†Ô∏è Fails
* **Day 5 (Part 2)** - Completed without any external help. I however had to resort to getting a hint on what algorithm to use in order to optimize, as my initial solution ran for +10 minutes. A small win on implementing an algorithm i didn't know before (Ford‚ÄìFulkerson).

* **Day 8 (Part 2)** - Completed but never finished *completely* on my own as my initial solution ran for hours without ever ending (Which i knew would happen..). I had to get a hint on how to optimize this, which lead to implementing LCM.

* **Day 10 (Part 2)** - After 12 hours of hacking away, i couldn't get a solution running that worked. Got a hint about implementing Picks Theorem with the Shoelace algorithm, which i tried (And apparently succeeded), but resorted to posting on reddit as it didn't work. It was however, another bug/mistake that caused it not to work - Not the algorithm itself nessecarily.
